# Flight price prediction

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
FareFinder AI predicts flight prices accurately using machine learning algorithms and predictive modeling. It helps travelers plan and book their trips by providing up-to-date and reliable information about flight costs, accessible through a website or mobile app

## Background
The problem that FareFinder AI aims to solve is the unpredictability and volatility of flight prices. It can be challenging for travelers to determine the best time to book their flights, especially when prices fluctuate frequently. The personal motivation behind this project is to provide travelers with a reliable and trustworthy tool that they can use to plan and book their trips without worrying about the cost of flights.

## Data and AI techniques
FareFinder AI will rely on various data sources, including historical flight prices, seasonal trends, and current market conditions. The AI techniques that will be used to analyze this data include machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and predictive modeling. By leveraging these techniques, FareFinder AI can provide travelers with accurate and up-to-date information about flight prices.
 
 ## How is it used
FareFinder AI is designed to be user-friendly and accessible. Users can access the tool through a website or mobile app and enter their desired travel dates and destinations to get an estimate of flight prices. This solution is used by anyone looking to book a flight and is concerned about the cost of flights. By providing accurate predictions of flight prices, FareFinder AI can help users plan their trips and make informed decisions about when to book their flights.

## Challenges
One major challenge of this project is accounting for the many external factors that can impact flight prices, such as political events, natural disasters, and economic downturns. Additionally, the constantly changing nature of the air travel industry can make it challenging to account for all the variables that can affect flight prices.

## What next
As FareFinder AI continues to grow, there are several ways it could become even more useful. For example, it could incorporate real-time data to provide users with up-to-the-minute flight price estimates. It could also use user feedback to improve the accuracy of its predictions over time.

## Acknowledgments
FareFinder AI was inspired by existing flight price comparison websites, such as Kayak and Skyscanner. Open source code and datasets may be used in the development of this project, and proper credit will be given to their creators.
